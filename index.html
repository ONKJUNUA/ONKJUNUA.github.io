            <h2>🛸 Introduction</h2>
            <h3>🤺 Geometry</h3>
            <p>
                Geometry is, with arithmetic, one of the oldest branches of mathematics.
                <br><br>It is concerned with properties of space such as the distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures.
                <br><br>Originally developed to model the physical world, geometry has applications in almost all sciences, and also in art, architecture, and other activities that are related to graphics.
            </p>
            <h3>🏢 Dimension</h3>
            <p>
                Where the traditional geometry allowed dimensions 1 (a line), 2 (a plane) and 3 (our ambient world conceived of as three-dimensional space), mathematicians and physicists have used higher dimensions for nearly two centuries.
                <br><br>One example of a mathematical use for higher dimensions is the configuration space of a physical system, which has a dimension equal to the system's degrees of freedom.
                <br><br>For instance, the configuration of a screw can be described by five coordinates.
            </p>
            <h3>🌐 Symmetry</h3>
            <p>
                The theme of symmetry in geometry is nearly as old as the science of geometry itself.
                <br><br>Symmetric shapes such as the circle, regular polygons and platonic solids held deep significance for many ancient philosophers and were investigated in detail before the time of Euclid.
                <br><br>Symmetric patterns occur in nature and were artistically rendered in a multitude of forms, including the graphics of Leonardo da Vinci, M. C. Escher, and others.

            <h2>🎥 Dimensions</h2>
            <h3>🧭 Zero Dimensional Space</h3>
            <p>
                In mathematics, a zero-dimensional topological space (or nildimensional space) is a topological space that has dimension zero with respect to one of several inequivalent notions of assigning a dimension to a given topological space.
                <br><br>A graphical illustration of a nildimensional space is a point.
                <br><br>All points of a zero-dimensional manifold are isolated.
                <br><br>In particular, the zero-dimensional hypersphere is a pair of points, and the zero-dimensional ball is a single point.
            </p>
            <h3>🔍 Points</h3>
            <p>
                Points are generally considered fundamental objects for building geometry.
                <br><br>They may be defined by the properties that they must have, as in Euclid's definition as "that which has no part", or in synthetic geometry.
                <br><br>In modern mathematics, they are generally defined as elements of a set called space, which is itself axiomatically defined.
            </p>
            <h3>📎 One Dimensional Space</h3>
            <p>
                In physics and mathematics, a sequence of n numbers can specify a location in n-dimensional space.
                <br><br>When n = 1, the set of all such locations is called a one-dimensional space. 
                <br><br>An example of a one-dimensional space is the number line, where the position of each point on it can be described by a single number.
            </p>
            <h3>📏 Lines</h3>
            <p>
                In modern mathematics, given the multitude of geometries, the concept of a line is closely tied to the way the geometry is described.
                <br><br>For instance, in analytic geometry, a line in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given linear equation, but in a more abstract setting, such as incidence geometry, a line may be an independent object, distinct from the set of points which lie on it.
            </p>
            <h3>🔬 Two Dimensional Space</h3>
            <p>
                A geometric setting in which two real quantities are required to determine the position of each point (element of the plane).
                <br><br>That includes affine notions of parallel lines, and also metrical notions of distance, circles, and angle measurement.
            </p>
            <h3>🔭 Three Dimensional Space</h3>
            <p>
                A mathematical structure in which three values (coordinates) are required to determine the position of a point.
                <br><br>More specifically, the three-dimensional space is the Euclidean space of dimension three that models physical space.

            <h3>📐 Triangles</h3>
            <p>
                A triangle is made up of three connected line segments.
                <br><br>It is a complex geometric figure since it can have variable angles and measurements. 
                <br><br>Notably, a triangle's name changes depending on its angles and the size of the sides.
                <br><br>For example, when two line segments of a triangle form a right angle, it is called a right triangle.
            </p>
            <h3>✉️ Rectangles</h3>
            <p>
                Rectangles have 4 sides and 4 right angles.
                <br><br>They all have 2 lines of symmetry (4 lines if they are also a square).
                <br><br>All rectangles belong to the parallelogram family.
            </p>
            <h3>⬜️ Squares</h3>
            <p>
                Squares have 4 equal sides and 4 right angles.
                <br><br>They have 4 lines of symmetry.
                <br><br>All squares belong to the rectangle family.
            </p>
            <h3>🕸 Pentagons</h3>
            <p>
                In geometry, a pentagon is any five-sided polygon or 5-gon.
                <br><br>The sum of the internal angles in a simple pentagon is 540°.
                <br><br>A pentagon may be simple or self-intersecting.
                <br><br>A self-intersecting regular pentagon (or star pentagon) is called a pentagram.
            </p>
            <h3>✡︎ Hexagons</h3>
            <p>
                In geometry, a hexagon is a six-sided polygon or 6-gon creating the outline of a cube.
                <br><br>The total of the internal angles of any simple (non-self-intersecting) hexagon is 720°.
            </p>
            <h3>⚪️ Circles</h3>
            <p>
                Circles have a point in the centre from which each point on the diameter is equidistant.
                <br><br>They have infinite lines of symmetry.
                <br><br>How many sides does a circle have?
                <br><br>This is an interesting question - the answer could be 0 (no straight sides),
                <br><br>1 curved side, or an infinite number of sides are all possible answers.

          <h3>🍙 Tetrahedrones</h3>
          <p>
            In geometry, a tetrahedron (plural: tetrahedra or tetrahedrons), also known as a triangular pyramid, is a polyhedron composed of four triangular faces, six straight edges, and four vertex corners.
            <br><br>The tetrahedron is the simplest of all the ordinary convex polyhedra.
          </p>
          <h3>🎲 Cubes</h3>
          <p>
            In geometry, a cube is a three-dimensional solid object bounded by six square faces, facets or sides, with three meeting at each vertex.
            <br><br>Viewed from a corner it is a hexagon and its net is usually depicted as a cross.
          </p>
          <h3>⚙️ Octahedrones</h3>
          <p>
            In geometry, an octahedron is a polyhedron with eight faces.
            <br><br>The term is most commonly used to refer to the regular octahedron, a Platonic solid composed of eight equilateral triangles, four of which meet at each vertex.
          </p>
          <h3>🪨 Dodecahedrones</h3>
          <p>
            In geometry, a dodecahedron is any polyhedron with twelve flat faces.
            <br><br>The most familiar dodecahedron is the regular dodecahedron with regular pentagons as faces, which is a Platonic solid.
            <br><br>There are also three regular star dodecahedra, which are constructed as stellations of the convex form.
          </p>
          <h3>🗿 Icosahedrones</h3>
          <p>
            In geometry, an icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 faces.
            <br><br>There are infinitely many non-similar shapes of icosahedra, some of them being more symmetrical than others.
            <br><br>The best known is the (convex, non-stellated) regular icosahedron—one of the Platonic solids—whose faces are 20 equilateral triangles.
          </p>
          <h3>🏐 Spheres</h3>
          <p>
            A sphere is a geometrical object that is a three-dimensional analogue to a two-dimensional circle.
            <br><br>A sphere is the set of points that are all at the same distance r from a given point in three-dimensional space.
            <br><br>That given point is the centre of the sphere, and r is the sphere's radius.
            <br><br>The earliest known mentions of spheres appear in the work of the ancient Greek mathematicians.

            <h3>✔ Angles</h3>
            <p>
                In Euclidean geometry, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle.
                <br><br>Angles formed by two rays lie in the plane that contains the rays. Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes. These are called dihedral angles.
                <br><br>Two intersecting curves may also define an angle, which is the angle of the rays lying tangent to the respective curves at their point of intersection.
            </p>
            <h3>🗻 Surfaces</h3>
            <p>
                In mathematics, a surface is a mathematical model of the common concept of a surface.
                <br><br>It is a generalization of a plane, but, unlike a plane, it may be curved; this is analogous to a curve generalizing a straight line.
                <br><br>There are several more precise definitions, depending on the context and the mathematical tools that are used for the study.
                <br><br>The simplest mathematical surfaces are planes and spheres in the Euclidean 3-space. The exact definition of a surface may depend on the context.
                <br><br>Typically, in algebraic geometry, a surface may cross itself (and may have other singularities), while, in topology and differential geometry, it may not.
            </p>
            <h3>〰 Curves</h3>
            <p>
                A curve is a 1-dimensional object that may be straight (like a line) or not.
                <br><br>Curves in 2-dimensional space are called plane curves and those in 3-dimensional space are called space curves.
                <br><br>In topology, a curve is defined by a function from an interval of the real numbers to another space.
                <br><br>In differential geometry, the same definition is used, but the defining function is required to be differentiable.
                <br><br>Algebraic geometry studies algebraic curves, which are defined as algebraic varieties of dimension one.
